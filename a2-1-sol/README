Restaurant Finder Part 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is the final implementation of an assignment that allows a user to
browse a map of Edmonton using a joystick and a display on an Arduino, and find
restaurants nearby where the user clicks the joystick. In this implementation,
the user can select a rating from 1 to 5 and this allows the user to filter out
restaurants that have a lower rating. Additionally, the user can now scroll
multiple screens in the restaurant selection menu, so now the user can choose
from all of the restaurants that match the rating criteria the user selects.

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1 x Arduino Mega Board
-1 x SainSmart Joystick
-1 x Adafruit ILI9341 display
-1 x 8GB SD Card

**SD card needs to be formatted in a very special way, however we cannot tell you how to
format it and put the files on it properly because that was done by the TAs and
we are not given access to the software.

Usage Instructions:

Now, you can use the joystick to move the red cursor on the screen. Choose the
desired minimum restaurant rating by touching the right side of the display, and
click the joystick to open a menu that will show all of the restaurants that
match the rating criteria (sorted by distance from where you clicked the
joystick on the map). Select a restaurant with the joystick to be shown where
on the map the restaurant is. The cursor will be hovering over the restaurant
you selected.

Note: to select the rating you want, you touch the right side of the display,
the selected restaurant ratings will be highlighted in yellow, while the ignored
ones will be unhighlighted (white).

Example: if you touch button 5, only restaurants of rating 5 will be displayed
when you click the joystick. If you touch button 3, restaurants of rating 3 or
higher will be available for you to select.

This code was based on the solution posted for part 1 on eclass. We decided to use the
solution from part 1 instead of our own solution, in case there were any errors,
we didn't want them to propagate to this part of the assignment.

The pivot and quicksort functions were developed from pseudo code that was
posted to eclass.
